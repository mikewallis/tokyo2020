data reformatted from the Tokyo2020 olympic games website https://olympics.com/tokyo-2020

events.csv: discipline,event title,gender/mixed category. There's scope for adding gold,silver,bronze fields later. Official Olympic guidelines have M F X and O for gender categories, X for mixed and O for not relevant, which is only used in equestrian events. I've just gone with mixed for O events.

disciplines.csv: discipline name, male participants, female participants, total participants
